# Welcome to the Packaging WoD

# Introduction to Packaging 101
In this workshop, we’ll go through the fundamentals of RPM packaging, from basic concepts up to packing a full application.

# Authors: [Bruno Cornec](mailto:bruno.cornec@hpe.com)

## Handouts
You can freely copy the Jupyter Notebooks, including their output, in order to practice back at your office at your own pace, leveraging a local installation of Jupyter Notebook on your laptop.
- You install the Jupyter Notebook application from [here](https://jupyter.org/install). 
- A Beginners Guide is also available [here](https://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html)

## Objectives of the Packaging Lab
At the end of the lab, students should be able to install ...

This lab is intended to support a trial and error method so that, during the session, students should fully understand what is behind the tool. Blindly following instructions is not an effective way to learn, IMHO. You've been warned ;-)

Expected duration : 120 minutes

## Reference documents
When dealing with the installation and configuration of RPM, the first step  is to check the reference website ...

## Lab flow
The Workshops-on-Demand are delivered through a central point that allows a portable, dynamic version of the lab guides. Rather than using standard PDF files, which always end in copy / paste errors from the lab guide into the TS sessions, this year we decided to innovate and introduce a brand-new infrastructure. We will leverage a JupyterHub server on which all the different lab guides will be stored in a notebook format (*.ipynb).

In a nutshell, a notebook works as follows:

• A notebook is a series of cells

• The notebook uses a kernel (visible in the upper right corner of the notebook)

• A cell can be markdown or code (in the selected kernel)

• To run a cell, use:

    o The Play Button at the top
    o Ctrl-Enter (run and stay on same cell)
    o Shift-Enter (run and move to next cell)
    
• Running a markdown cell is just rendering it

• Running a code cell runs the code and displays the output just below the cell

• When a cell is running, it displays a [*] to its left. Then, when finished, it displays a counter of the number of executions of that cell

• You cannot run a cell when another is already running, but you can interrupt a running cell with the stop button

Enjoy the labs ! :-)
